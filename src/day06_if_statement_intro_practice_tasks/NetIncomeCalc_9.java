9. Create a class named NetIncomeCalc,
Write a program that can calculate the salary after tax
based on the following requirements
                the tax rates are:
                        35% for a salary of 130K or more
                        30% for a salary of 100K to 129k
                        25% for a salary of 80K to 99K
                        20% for a salary of 79K or less

                in addition, if the person is married, he/she will pay 5% less tax
